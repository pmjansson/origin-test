This is the first paragraph. It will definitely be included in the index page, so it should be a rational summary of the entry.

This is the second paragraph. Depending on how the index page is rendered, it may be included in the index page summary, but I kinda hope note.

This is the third paragraph. What I would prefer is for the description to show up in the index page summary.
